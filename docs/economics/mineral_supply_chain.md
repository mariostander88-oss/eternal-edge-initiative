# 🌍 Mineral Supply Chain & Logistics Strategy

This document outlines the procurement strategy for the **Eternal Edge Initiative**, capitalizing on the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region's dominance in strategic minerals.

## 1. Strategic Sourcing Map

| Element | Primary Source | Mine / Region | Logistics Route |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Titanium (Ti)** | 🇿🇦 South Africa | Richards Bay Minerals (KZN) | N2 Highway -> Durban Port -> Cape Town |
| **Zirconium (Zr)** | 🇿🇦 South Africa / 🇳🇦 Namibia | Namakwa Sands / Rössing | N7 Highway / Walvis Bay Corridor |
| **Nickel (Ni)** | 🇿🇼 Zimbabwe | Bindura Nickel Corp / Great Dyke | Beitbridge Border Post -> N1 Highway |
| **Copper (Cu)** | 🇿🇲 Zambia / 🇿🇦 South Africa | Copperbelt / Palabora Mining | T3 Road -> Kazungula Bridge -> N1 |
| **Palladium (Pd)** | 🇿🇦 South Africa | Bushveld Complex (Rustenburg) | Rail Transport (Transnet Freight) |

## 2. Competitive Advantage
By manufacturing locally within the SADC region, we eliminate significant overhead costs:
* **No trans-oceanic shipping of raw ore:** We process near the source.
* **Duty-Free Trade:** Utilizing SADC trade agreements for moving Ni and Cu across borders.
* **Currency Arbitrage:** Sourcing inputs in ZAR/local currencies while selling finished tools in USD.

## 3. Risk Mitigation
* **Supply Volatility:** Zirconium supply is diversified between SA west coast and Namibia to prevent single-point bottlenecks.
* **Energy Security:** Manufacturing facility to include solar supplementation (Solar PV) to mitigate load shedding risks during the melting phase.
