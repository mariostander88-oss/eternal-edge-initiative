## 📌 Project Overview

The **Eternal Edge Initiative** is a scientific and economic proposal exploring the development of a new class of ultra-durable cutting tools using *High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs)* and *Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMGs)*.

These materials leverage **atomic-scale disorder** to produce blades that:

- Do not dull easily  
- Resist corrosion  
- Have extremely high strength  
- Are manufacturable using Africa’s abundant mineral resources  

This project demonstrates how South Africa can transition from exporting raw ores to manufacturing **high-value precision tools** and advanced materials.

## 📚 Scientific Basis

### 🔬 1. High-Entropy Alloy (HEA) Concept
HEAs are multi-element metal alloys where 4–6 elements are mixed in near-equal proportions, creating:

- Severe lattice distortion  
- Suppressed atomic movement  
- High strength and wear resistance  

### 🔬 2. Bulk Metallic Glass (BMG) Concept
BMGs are formed when molten metal is cooled rapidly enough to “freeze” into an **amorphous** (glass-like) structure.

Benefits include:

- No grain boundaries  
- No dislocations  
- High hardness  
- High elastic strain limit  

### 🔬 3. Hybrid HEA–BMG System
By combining both concepts, the **Cape Town Alloy** achieves:

- Ceramic-like hardness  
- Steel-like toughness  
- Extreme edge retention  
- Low maintenance requirements  

This hybrid approach is based on real published materials science.

## 🧪 Proposed Alloy Composition

| Element | Role | Source Region |
|---------|------|----------------|
| **Ti** | Strength, low density | South Africa (Richards Bay) |
| **Zr** | Glass-forming stabilizer | South Africa & Namibia |
| **Ni** | Ductility, toughness | Zimbabwe |
| **Cu** | Castability, corrosion resistance | Zambia / South Africa |
| **Pd/Pt** | Corrosion resistance, stability | Bushveld Complex (SA) |

**Suggested ratio:**  
`Ti25 - Zr25 - Ni25 - Cu20 - Pd5`

- Cooling rate of 1000–10,000 K/s  
- Maintain inert argon environment  

### 3. Shaping & Finishing
- CNC final shaping  
- Laser micro-honing  
- Ion-beam polishing  

### 4. Expected Properties
- Hardness: 8–9 GPa  
- Edge retention: ~10× carbon steel  
- Wear resistance: ~3× stainless steel  
- High corrosion resistance
